This is Simple CRUD using Redux and API from https://dummy.restapiexample.com/

Because restapiexample is free and public, we will get 'Too many requests' response for many times.
So, I modified some functions to keep updating the data in Redux even when the response failed, to make the testing easier.
I put some '// NOTE:' for those parts.

Makefile is also created to simplified some commands.
TO INSTALL THE APPLICATION, RUN: make android

I hope this application fulfilling all requirement for the test.
Thank you.
